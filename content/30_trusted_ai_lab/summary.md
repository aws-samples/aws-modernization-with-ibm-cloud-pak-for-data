# Summary

In this code pattern, we have learned how to extract data from different sources, pre-process the data, generate two use cases, and build multiple models in SageMaker notebooks using SageMaker in-built algorithms & open sourced modules. We have also learned how to port SageMaker notebooks into Watson Studio to generate SageMaker endpoints. We have configured Watson Open Scale to set up & monitor SageMaker endpoints in Cloud Pak for Data for Fairness, Quality & Drift metrics. This methodology helps to integrate different services using IBM & AWS for building end-to-end solutions.
