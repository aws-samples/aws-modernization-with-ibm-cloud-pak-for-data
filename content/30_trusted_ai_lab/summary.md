# Summary

In this code pattern, we have learnt how to extract data from different sources, pre-process the data, generate two use-cases, build multiple models in SageMaker notebooks using SageMaker in-built algorithms & open sourced modules. We have also learnt how to port SageMaker notebooks into Watson Studio to generate SageMaker endpoints. We have configured Watson Open Scale to setup & monitor SageMaker endpoints for Fairness, Quality & Drift metrics. This is a good example of migration story from SageMaker to Cloud Pak for data and integration of different services using IBM & AWS to build end to end solution.
